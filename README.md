# QredoLocation

Share your location, but only with your trusted contacts.

Bump your phones together and establish trust via NFC, and then see each other's location update in realtime, even when the app isn't running.

# Building

To build, you must

*   obtain the qredo-android-sdk-0.8.jar from [Qredo](http://qredo.com/) and put it in `app/libs`
*   create an `app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml` file that defines the `app_secret` String property.

Then, use Android Studio or Gradle.
